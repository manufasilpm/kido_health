                Vaccines are products that are usually given in childhood to protect against serious, 
                often deadly diseases. By stimulating your bodyâ€™s natural defenses, 
                they prepare your body to fight the disease faster and more effectively.

                Vaccines help your immune system fight infections more efficiently by sparking your immune response to specific diseases.

                your immune system will already know how to fight it.`
